    <h1>What is an Upload Page?</h1>
    <h2>Uploading is the process of moving digital files such as photographs or documents from your computer and placing them on to a central server so that someone else can retrieve them or to a website so others can see them. For example, you might save photographs from your digital camera on to your computer and upload them on to a social network such as Facebook, where you can allow friends and family to see them.</h2>
